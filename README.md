# VmStorage
Quick storage for Virtual Machine init scripts

## Vagrantfile
My vagrantfile for initiating a scotchbox VM for either PHP5 or 7.  Installs and sets up some basic things not included in Scotchbox, sets up a default database, imports from a SQL file, and gives you connection details for the app SQL Pro.

### Known Issues
* XDebug does not work
